## Amelia's Biography

My name is Amelia Butcher. I am 22 years old and am from Charleston, SC. I grew up in Summerville, but moved to Charleston for high school. I live with my parents and my identical twin sister, Sophia. I also have an older sister, Kelsey, who lives in New York City. We currently have four cats:

-Fluffernutter
-Itty Bitty Kitty
-Filbert (who is Sophia's)
-Earl Gray

I am currently looking for a full-time job in the Software Engineering field, as I studied Computer Science for my undergraduate degree at the College of Charleston, but for now, I work at The OOPS! Co. on King Street.
